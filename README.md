### Running the Program

Main class:
1. Set up the bouncer, bricks, and paddle
2. Set up the rules for the bouncer, bricks, paddle, and power-ups
3. Set up the level and score
4. Set up cheat keys
5. Run animation

Data files needed:

5. level_2.txt
6. level_3.txt

Key/Mouse inputs:

Cheat keys:
1. press "L" increases the number of lives
2. press "E" enlarges the ball
3. press "1/2/3/4/5/6" to jump to the certain level
4. press "R" to restart the ball and the paddle
5. press "N" to make the whole paddle bounce normally

Known Bugs:
1. The bouncer does not bounce off the bricks correctly when the bouncer speed is very large
2. Sometimes the power-up does release the effect when hitting the paddle
3. The bouncer will oscillate on the top of the screen if the player uses the cheat key to jump to a certain level
4. The bouncer will oscillate on the edge if it is released on top left or top right of the screen

### Notes

I have learned a lot from programming this BreakOut game. It was the first time that I spent so much time on constructing on project and it helped me gain better understanding of Object-Oriented Programming.

### Impressions

I like this project. It is very challenging while rewarding.
